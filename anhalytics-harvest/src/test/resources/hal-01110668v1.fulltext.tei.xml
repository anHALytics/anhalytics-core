                <head n="1">Introduction</head>
                <p>Over the last three decades, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as powerful human therapeutics due to advances in antibody engineering technologies 
                    <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Nonhuman antibodies induce an immune response in humans, which limits their therapeutic use 
                    <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. To overcome this problem, humanized antibodies have been constructed by grafting the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of murine mAbs onto human framework regions (FRs), which is commonly referred to as CDR grafting 
                    <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Simple grafting of CDRs, however, often decreases affinity, because some FR residues directly contact the antigen or support conformation of the CDR loops 
                    <ref type="bibr">[4] [5]</ref>. Therefore, humanized antibodies are usually constructed by CDR grafting while retaining those mouse FR residues that influence antigenbinding activity 
                    <ref type="bibr">[6] [7]</ref>. These humanized antibodies are generally less immunogenic in patients than chimeric antibodies that are composed of mouse variable domains and human constant domains; however, they may still be immunogenic since the CDRs are not human 
                    <ref type="bibr">[8] [9]</ref>. Therefore, to minimize the immunogenicity of humanized antibodies, only the mouse CDR residues that influence antigen binding (i.e., specificity-determining residues, or SDRs) are retained, while those that are not involved in antigen binding are replaced by human counterparts 
                    <ref type="bibr">[10] [11] [12] [13]</ref>. SDR-grafted humanized antibodies exhibit less immunogenic potential than CDR-grafted humanized antibodies. HBV is a worldwide public health problem that affects 240 million chronic carriers, who have a high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma 
                    <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>. The HBV envelope contains three related surface glycoproteins called the large (L), middle (M), and small (S) proteins.
                </p>
                <p>These proteins are the product of a single open reading frame that is divided into preS1, preS2, and S regions 
                    <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. The S protein is encoded by the S region; the M protein contains the preS2 and S antigens; and the L protein contains the preS1, preS2, and S antigens. The three antigens have been shown to elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies 
                    <ref type="bibr">[16] [17] [18] [19] [20]</ref>. In particular, the preS1(amino acids 2–48, ayw subtype) of the L protein and the common &quot; a &quot; determinant of the S antigen have been shown to play an essential role in viral infectivity 
                    <ref type="bibr">[21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>Recently a cellular receptor for the pre-S1 sequence was identified as sodium taurocholate transporter (NTCP)

                    <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. For immunoprophylaxis of HBV infection, hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) prepared from pooled human anti-HBsAg plasma is administered to infants born of HBsAg-HBeAg–positive mothers, to susceptible individuals with acute exposure to infectious HBV-containing material, and to orthotopic liver transplant patients with chronic HBV-related liver disease 
                    <ref type="bibr">[30] [31] [32]</ref>. However, the currently available HBIG is not an ideal source of antibody due to its limited availability and low specific activity. Virus-neutralizing mAbs against the preS1 and S antigens would be an effective alternative for immunoprophylaxis of HBV infection.
                </p>
                <p>We previously generated a murine mAb (KR127) that recognizes amino acids 37–45 (NSNNPDWDF) of the preS1 of adr subtype, corresponding to aa 26–34 of ayw subtype, and subsequently constructed a humanized antibody (HzKR127) by CDR grafting. HzKR127 retained the same epitope specificity and affinity as KR127 and exhibited HBV-neutralizing activity in chimpanzees 
                    <ref type="bibr">[33] [34] [35]</ref>. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of the HzKR127 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) and its complex with the epitope to understand the structural mechanisms of the antigen–antibody interaction 
                    <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>.
                </p>
                <p>In the present study, based on the structural information, we further humanized HzKR127 by SDR grafting and also improved its affinity by mutating two heavy-chain CDR residues.</p>
                <p>The resulting humanized antibody (HzKR127-3.2) exhibited higher HBV-neutralizing activity than KR127 and lower immunogenic potential than HzKR127. The enhanced virusneutralizing activity was achieved by an increase in the association rate. This information will be useful for the design and development of potent antibody therapeutics against HBV, and this advanced humanized antibody may be a good candidate for immunoprophylaxis of HBV infection.</p>

                <p>We previously constructed an anti-preS1 humanized antibody (HzKR127) from the murine mAb KR127 by CDR grafting. In HzKR127, the CDRs of mouse VH and VL were grafted into human germline segments DP7-JH4 and DPK12-JK4, respectively, while eleven FR residues in the mouse VH and five FR residues in the mouse VL that were thought to influence the CDR loops or to stabilize the structure of the variable regions were retained 
                    <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>. The amino acid sequences of the VH and VL of KR127 and HzKR127 are shown in 
                    <ref type="figure">Figure 1.</ref> In this study, we further humanized HzKR127 by SDR grafting and increased its affinity by site-directed mutagenesis.
                </p>
                <p>For SDR grafting, mouse residues that are buried and/or not involved in antigen binding are replaced by human counterparts, based on the previously determined three-dimensional structure of the antigen–antibody complex 
                    <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>.For the VH, nine mouse FR residues (Val12, Ala28, Ser30, Ile48, Lys66, Ala67, Leu69, Ala78, and Phe91) were replaced by human residues, while two mouse FR3 residues (Ala71 and Lys73) that are involved in the interaction with HCDR2 loop were retained. Ala71 is in hydrophobic interaction with Ile51 and Pro53, and Lys 73 is in hydrogen bonding with Gly54 (
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A</ref>). For the VL, three mouse FR residues (Leu3, Ser43, and Lys45) were replaced by human residues, while two mouse FR2 residues (Leu36 and Arg46) were retained. Leu36 forms a tight interaction with Trp103 of VH in the bottom of the antigen-binding pocket and is close to the Glu98 side chain of the HCDR3 loop (
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. 2B</ref>). Thus, mutation of Leu36 to Tyr is likely to disturb the conformation of the antigen-binding pocket and prohibit optimal binding to the antigen. Residue Arg46 forms a salt bridge with Asp97 in HCDR3, which stabilizes the conformation of HCDR3 in the free structure (
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. 3A</ref>). In addition to the FR residues, two LCDR2 residues (
                    <ref type="bibr">Lys53 and</ref> Leu54) were replaced by human residues because they are not involved in antigen binding (
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. 2C</ref>).
                </p>
                <p>The designed humanized VH and VL sequences were synthesized and combined with human C1 and C, respectively, to construct expression plasmid pdCMV-dhfrC-HzKR127-3.</p>
                <p>This plasmid DNA was introduced into HEK293T cells, and the resulting humanized antibody (HzKR127-3) was purified from the culture supernatant. Affinity determination by competition ELISA indicated that the affinity of HzKR127-3 for GST-preS1 was slightly lower than that of the original KR127 antibody (Supplemental 
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). Affinity determination by Octet Red indicated that HzKR127-3 had approximately 3-fold lower affinity (K D ) compared to KR127; this decrease was due mostly to an increase in the dissociation rate (Supplemental 
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. S2A</ref> and S2B and 
                    <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).

                <head n="3.2">Affinity maturation of HzKR127-3</head>
                <p>In our previous structural study, a comparison of the structures of free HzKR127 Fab and its complex with the preS1 epitope revealed that the HCDR3 loop undergoes the most noticeable conformational change between the free and complex structures, illustrating a lidopening mechanism for antigen binding 
                    <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>. As shown in 
                    <ref type="figure">Figure 3A</ref>, the Asp97 residue is not involved in a direct interaction with the preS1 antigen; rather, it forms a salt bridge with Arg46 in the light chain FR2, which stabilizes closing of the HCDR3 lid in the free structure.
                </p>
                <p>However, upon antigen binding, the HCDR3 loop lid is opened and an antigen-binding pocket is thereby created, leading to tight locking in of the peptide (
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. 3B</ref>). Residue Asp97 is located at the apex of the HCDR3 lid and undergoes the largest movement, with a 9.6 Å shift in the main chain upon lid opening (Supplemental 
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>). Alanine mutation of the Asp97 would disrupt the salt bridge, making the HCDR3 loop more flexible. This could facilitate the structural transition from the closed to the open state, thus leading to an increase in affinity. We therefore substituted an alanine for Asp97 of HzKR127-3. The resulting antibody (HzKR127-3.1) was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells, purified, and subjected to affinity determination by competition ELISA followed by

                    <figDesc>−9 M), and the increase in affinity was achieved mostly by a decrease in the dissociation rate (Supplemental

                </p>
                <p>In an attempt to further increase the affinity of HzKR127-3.1, Asn58 in HCDR2 of HzKR127-3.1 was mutated to alanine and subjected to competition ELISA, which showed an increase in affinity (data not shown). This indicates that Asn58 is not optimal for antigen binding. We speculated that the replacement of Asn58 by alanine, which has a smaller side chain, would give the preS1 epitope easier access to the antigen-binding pocket, which could result in a faster association rate (
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. 2D</ref>). Therefore, Asn58 was replaced by the human counterpart (Ser58) as a first choice. The resulting humanized antibody (HzKR127-3.2) was transiently expressed, purified, and subjected to affinity determination. The affinity of HzKR127-3.2 (4.93 × 10 −10 M) was 1.6-fold higher than that of HzKR127-3.1, and the increased affinity was achieved mostly by an increase in the association rate (Supplemental

As shown in Figure 4A, HzKR127-3.2 exhibited the same epitope specificity as that of KR127.</p>
                <p>In addition, to determine whether HzKR127-3.2 does not exhibit off-target activity, flow cytometric analysis was performed. To prepare preS1-expressing cells (293T-S1-L1) as a positive control, preS1 (amino acids 37–47) was fused to the N-terminus of the integral membrane protein L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM). The fusion protein was then transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. HzKR127-3.2 bound to the surface of the 293T-S1- L1 cells but did not bind to preS1-negative cells such as HEK293T, L1CAM-overexpressing human cholangiocarcinoma (SCK-L1), human renal carcinoma (ACHN), mouse melanoma (B16F1), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (

                <p>Because HzKR127-3.2 exhibited higher affinity for the preS1 antigen than KR127, we compared their virus-neutralizing activities by in vitro HBV-neutralization assay. To begin with, we confirmed binding of the antibodies to the viral particles. As shown in 
                    <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref>, the antibodies bound to the ayw and adr particles in a dose-dependent manner, and HzKR127-3.2 bound more efficiently compared to KR127. Next, HepaRG cells were infected with either the adr or ayw subtype of HBV particles, which had been preincubated with different concentrations (0.2–200 g/ml) of each antibody. The infected cells were then cultured for 10 days, and the growth medium was changed every 2 days. On day 10 postinfection, HBsAg secretion by the infected cells was measured by ELISA. As shown in 
                    <ref type="figure">Figure 5B</ref> and 5C, the HBsAg secretion rate gradually decreased with increasing antibody concentration, demonstrating the specificity of the neutralization assay, and HzKR127-3.2 exhibited enhanced virus-neutralizing activity against both adr and ayw subtypes compared to KR127.
                </p>
                <p>We also performed the HBV infection and neutralization assay in the presence of 4% PEG 8000. The presence of PEG increases the infectivity and thus allowed to use five-fold diluted inoculum without compromising infectivity 
                    <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref>. Because this assay has a higher ratio of antibody molecules to viral particles compared to the assay in the absence of PEG, it was expected to improve the neutralization activity of the antibodies, although it is not under physiological conditions. Indeed the infection level was higher since HBsAg production reached 100 ng/ml, and an almost complete neutralization was observed with the highest antibody dose, while HzKR127-3.2 neutralized the viral particles more efficiently than KR127 (Supplemental 
                    <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>).

                <p>We had previously constructed the CDR-grafted humanized antibody HzKR127; the epitope specificity and affinity of HzKR127 are the same as those of the original murine mAb, KR127. HzKR127 virus-neutralizing activity was confirmed in chimpanzees. Subsequently, the crystal structures of HzKR127 Fab and its complex with the epitope revealed that HzKR127 exerts a lid-opening mechanism for antigen binding, one of the largest conformational changes in antigen–antibody recognition. In the present study, we successfully optimized HzKR127 through SDR grafting and affinity maturation by rational design based on the antigen–antibody complex structure. A total of 15 (12 in FR, one in HCDR2, and two in LCDR2) mouse residues in HzKR127 were replaced by human residues, and Asp97 in HCDR3 was replaced by alanine. The resulting humanized antibody (HzKR127-3.2) exhibited 2.5-fold higher affinity for the preS1 antigen and enhanced virusneutralizing activity against both adr and ayw subtypes of HBV compared to KR127.</p>
                <p>Moreover, it retained the same epitope specificity as that of KR127 and did not show any offtarget activity, as assessed by flow cytometric analysis. In addition, T epitope analysis suggested that HzKR127-3.2 may be less immunogenic in humans than HzKR127.</p>
                <p>Considering that HzKR127 exhibited virus-neutralizing activity in chimpanzees, HzKR127- 3.2 might exhibit higher in vivo virus-neutralizing activity than HzKR127 and thus may be more effective in the immunoprophylaxis of HBV infection. HzKR127-3.2 may be particularly useful for repeated administration to humans because of its minimized immunogenic potential. KR127 and HzKR127-3.2 target amino acids 37-45 from the L protein of adr subtype, corresponding to amino acids 26-34 of ayw subtype. This epitope lies in preS1 region of the L protein which is involved in HBV infectivity, since the target of the peptide(amino acids 2- 47, ayw subtype) was identified as NTCP and shown to be a functional receptor for HBV entry 
                    <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. Therefore, our antibodies target a region crucial for HBV infectivity and thus were expected to block entry. However, Bremer et al. reported that antibodies against preS1(1-21) of ayw subtypes reacted well with non-myristoylated preS1 peptides but only weakly with myristoylated preS1 peptides and did not neutralize the infectivity of HBV, whereas antibodies to neighboring sequences neutralized very well 
                    <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>. The data suggest that antibodies to preS1(22-47) of ayw subtypes are likely to bind well to HBV and neutralize viral infectivity. Indeed, we observed that HzKR127-3.2 recognizing preS1(37-45) of adr subtypes bound to the viral particles of both ayw and adr subtypes and neutralized them efficiently. Analysis of antigen-antibody interaction of HzKR127-3.2 indicated that seven residues in the epitope sequence, except Ser38 and Asn39, are essential for antibody binding (
                    <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). Among the essential residues, five residues (Asn37, Pro41, Asp42, Trp43, and Asp44) are highly conserved among genotypes 
                    <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>, while the other two residues (
                    <ref type="bibr">Asn40 and</ref> Phe45) are infrequently changed to serine and leucine or histidine, respectively in some genotypes. Neutralization efficiency of HzKR127-3.2 against these genotypes remains to be determined.

                <p>Regarding the correlation between kinetic parameters and virus-neutralizing potency, studies with mAbs against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein have shown that a direct relationship exists between the association rate and RSV-neutralizing activity 
                    <ref type="bibr">[48] [49] [50]</ref>, while studies with other viral pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus or rotavirus, have shown that virus-neutralizing activity can be determined predominantly by the dissociation rate 
                    <ref type="bibr">[51] [52]</ref>. In case of HBV-neutralizing antibody, a recent study showed no correlation between the affinity of anti-S monoclonal antibodies and their ability to neutralize HBV infection 
                    <ref type="bibr">[53]</ref>. In this study, HzKR127-3.2 exhibited 2.5-fold higher affinity for the preS1 and enhanced in vitro virus-neutralizing activity against both adr and ayw subtypes of HBV compared to KR127, while the association rate was 2.3-fold faster and the dissociation rate was slightly slower. These data indicate that the enhanced virus-neutralizing activity was achieved by an increased association rate, which suggests that the association rate of anti- preS1 antibodies may play a predominant role in HBV neutralization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show a direct relationship between the association rate and neutralizing potency in antibody-mediated HBV neutralization. Our findings may provide insights that will help to facilitate the engineering of potent antibody therapeutics for HBV immunoprophylaxis.
